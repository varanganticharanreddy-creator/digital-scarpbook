      <h2>The Day We Met</h2>
      <p class="muted">Short & sweet memory</p>
      <p>We first connected in our college WhatsApp group, talking till midnight without even knowing each otherâ€™s faces. Due to a small misunderstanding, we didnâ€™t speak after that. On 28th August 2024, during orientation, she saw me, but I had no idea she was my cute little pie. Then, on 13th September near the library, I noticed her again, looking so adorable. Finally, on my birthday night, 16th September 2024, she messaged meâ€”and thatâ€™s where our journeyÂ trulyÂ began.</p>

          <p><strong>Where:</strong> Our first meeting was on the afternoon of 1st October 2024 at the collegeÂ cafeteria.</p>
          <p><strong>Memory:</strong> We stayed together for almost half a day, and that was the first time we sat so close to each other. For me, it was the very first time sitting beside a girl, and she was the first one I truly enjoyed being with. That day was filled with beautiful memoriesâ€”we talked a lot and got to know a little more about each other. It was also the first day she playfully hit me on my back ðŸ˜­, and I realized she would hit hard just like my mother. I even showed her all the photos in my gallery. It was such a cute,Â littleÂ day.</p>

      <h2>The First "I Love You"</h2>
      <p class="muted">When it happened</p>
      <p>The first "I love you" happened on 28th September 2024, during our college Freshersâ€™ Day. That day, I gave her a red rose to express my love for her, but I didnâ€™t actually say the words. Later, during the Dussehra vacation while we were at our homes, on the night of 7th October 2024, we were talking on a call. The day before, I had told her that I was missing her, but that night I finally said, "I loveÂ you"Â toÂ her.</p>
